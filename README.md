This repo covers the basic machine learning classification  projects/problems using various machine learning classification techniques and MLP Neural Network through scikit learn library

# [Project 1 : Gender Voice Classification ]
* The file cbndex1.ipynb was the very first attempt/beginner problem solution I worked on. It does basic LogisticRegression to classify voice by male or female and displays the Confusion Matrix, with Accuracy, Precision, and Recall Score to evaluate the classifier  
* The file Boston_Housing_Price_ML.ipynb is the latest edition, applying complex functions and creating a framework where data can go through few models and train test, predict, and evaluate which I learned as I progressed through the intermediate and advanced training and applied it to the very first classification problem Gender Voice : Using Logistic Regression Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, K-nearest-neighbors Classifier, K-nearest-neighbors Classifier, and Multilayer Preceptron Classifier, Decision Trees and Random Forest for warm start ML to classify the gender voice.
